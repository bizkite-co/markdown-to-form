+You and I created a Azure Function App as described in the `create-function.ipynb` list of Azure CLI commands. We used the `config-local-git` option and that didn't work. It created a git repo URL that I was not able to clone, and the repo was not accessable in the web GUI, so I unlinked that git repo and connected the Function App to a GitHub repo that this chat is in the local version of. Now I need to recreate the Function App code and spec in this repo, I think, and when I commit it, I think that will allow us to deploy it to the Azure Function App. This is a new Function App, so there is no concern about existing code logic. That hasn't been implemented yet. We are just getting the Function App DevOps set up at this point, and then we will implement logic.

+I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
+npm install @azure/functions
+func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

+There were some serious configuration issues, all having to do with your misunderstanding of the file tree. You tried several times to add files that didn't exist. You should have a map of the file structure, but run `pwd` and ` tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'` if you have any questions. Your `pacakge.json` `start` script, for instance, started with `cd MarkdownToSurvey && function start`, but the `package.json` is in the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory. There is the additional confusion of having two `MarkdownToSurvey` segments in the `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js` path. What are the names of the two segments? Is the outer one the `Function App` and the inner one the `function`? I would like to talk about how to make them unique. I've edited the `package.json` and a couple other files, so don't edit them without getting the latest version. Now, if I navigate to `markdown-to-form/MarkdownToSurvey/` and run `npm start`, I get this: 
+```sh
+ npm start
+
+> markdown-to-form@1.0.0 start
+> func start

+So, you attempted edit failed because you seemed to be editing different content.

+Ok, I have deployed the sitesuccessfully and I am getting a 200 result. I also changed the `authLevel` to anonymous, to make troubleshooting easier, but I have put the `_master` `Key` in the `./.envrc` in the root, so I would like to update the `markdown-to-form.http` to use that properly.
+I also need to start generating the logic that will loop through the `UserSurvey.md` and produce a Office 365 Form from it.

+Currently, the function is expecting the markdown form to be available in the same directory:
+```js
+        const markdownContent = await fs.readFile(markdownPath, 'utf8');
+```
+That won't work well for more than one survey, which defeats the whole purpose of this function. I need to be able to pass markdown text in the function call, and I need the `markdown-to-survey.http` updated to read the contents of the file and pass it up to the function call.

+Ok, I have the function running locally, and I have added some logging to the `index.js` to help me parse the uploaded document, but I am getting this:

# 2024-11-17 11:44:53.368301
+The function is already running locally, so you don't need to keep restarting it, but if you did you'd have to use `npm start` if you want to start it from the `package.json` dir. Now, I'm getting this:
+```json
+[2024-11-17T19:39:57.150Z] Raw Markdown Content: {{$fileContent UserSurvey.md}}

+[2024-11-17T19:39:57.151Z] ]
+```
+I think your `markdown-to-survey.http` is just passing the path to the markdown file, whereas it needs to pass the contents. I think the file content might have to be converted to base64, but I think the Rest Client has a way of doing that.

# 2024-11-17 11:46:39.439011
+That gives me this:
+```

# 2024-11-17 11:50:21.115413
+The REST Client help says this:
+```
+You can also specify file path to use as a body, which starts with < , the file path(whitespaces should be preserved) can be either in absolute or relative(relative to workspace root or current http file) formats:
