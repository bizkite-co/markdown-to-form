+You and I created a Azure Function App as described in the `create-function.ipynb` list of Azure CLI commands. We used the `config-local-git` option and that didn't work. It created a git repo URL that I was not able to clone, and the repo was not accessable in the web GUI, so I unlinked that git repo and connected the Function App to a GitHub repo that this chat is in the local version of. Now I need to recreate the Function App code and spec in this repo, I think, and when I commit it, I think that will allow us to deploy it to the Azure Function App. This is a new Function App, so there is no concern about existing code logic. That hasn't been implemented yet. We are just getting the Function App DevOps set up at this point, and then we will implement logic.

+Do I need to create a `function.json` in the `MarkdownToSurvey` like this?

# 2024-11-15 22:11:26.465182
+And I think I might need a `host.json` and to move the `index.json` into the `MarkdownToSurvay/`. What else do I need to deploy it and test the current DevOps state?

+I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
+npm install @azure/functions
+func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

+There were some serious configuration issues, all having to do with your misunderstanding of the file tree. You tried several times to add files that didn't exist. You should have a map of the file structure, but run `pwd` and ` tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'` if you have any questions. Your `pacakge.json` `start` script, for instance, started with `cd MarkdownToSurvey && function start`, but the `package.json` is in the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory. There is the additional confusion of having two `MarkdownToSurvey` segments in the `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js` path. What are the names of the two segments? Is the outer one the `Function App` and the inner one the `function`? I would like to talk about how to make them unique. I've edited the `package.json` and a couple other files, so don't edit them without getting the latest version. Now, if I navigate to `markdown-to-form/MarkdownToSurvey/` and run `npm start`, I get this: 
+```sh
+ npm start
+
+> markdown-to-form@1.0.0 start
+> func start
