Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.

# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER You and I created a Azure Function App as described in the `create-function.ipynb` list of Azure CLI commands. We used the `config-local-git` option and that didn't work. It created a git repo URL that I was not able to clone, and the repo was not accessable in the web GUI, so I unlinked that git repo and connected the Function App to a GitHub repo that this chat is in the local version of. Now I need to recreate the Function App code and spec in this repo, I think, and when I commit it, I think that will allow us to deploy it to the Azure Function App. This is a new Function App, so there is no concern about existing code logic. That hasn't been implemented yet. We are just getting the Function App DevOps set up at this point, and then we will implement logic.

ASSISTANT I understand that we need to set up the Azure Function App project structure. For an Azure Function App using Node.js, we'll need to create several key files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. `host.json` - Configuration for the Azure Functions runtime
ASSISTANT 2. `local.settings.json` - Local development settings
ASSISTANT 3. `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
ASSISTANT 4. A function file (likely `index.js` or a function-specific file)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll help you create these files with basic configurations. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT `host.json`:

ASSISTANT             }
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT text: Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER You and I created a Azure Function App as described in the `create-function.ipynb` list of Azure CLI commands. We used the `config-local-git` option and that didn't work. It created a git repo URL that I was not able to clone, and the repo was not accessable in the web GUI, so I unlinked that git repo and connected the Function App to a GitHub repo that this chat is in the local version of. Now I need to recreate the Function App code and spec in this repo, I think, and when I commit it, I think that will allow us to deploy it to the Azure Function App. This is a new Function App, so there is no concern about existing code logic. That hasn't been implemented yet. We are just getting the Function App DevOps set up at this point, and then we will implement logic.

ASSISTANT I understand that we need to set up the Azure Function App project structure. For an Azure Function App using Node.js, we'll need to create several key files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. `host.json` - Configuration for the Azure Functions runtime
ASSISTANT 2. `local.settings.json` - Local development settings
ASSISTANT 3. `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
ASSISTANT 4. A function file (likely `index.js` or a function-specific file)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll help you create these files with basic configurations. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT `host.json`:
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "version": "2.0",
ASSISTANT     "logging": {
ASSISTANT         "applicationInsights": {
ASSISTANT             "samplingSettings": {
ASSISTANT                 "isEnabled": true,
ASSISTANT                 "excludedTypes": "Request"
ASSISTANT             }
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT `local.settings.json`:
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "IsEncrypted": false,
ASSISTANT     "Values": {
ASSISTANT         "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
ASSISTANT         "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
ASSISTANT         "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION": "~18"
ASSISTANT     },
ASSISTANT     "Host": {
ASSISTANT         "CORS": "*"
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT `package.json`:
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "name": "markdown-to-survey",
ASSISTANT     "version": "1.0.0",
ASSISTANT     "description": "Azure Function to convert Markdown to Survey Form",
ASSISTANT     "main": "index.js",
ASSISTANT     "scripts": {
ASSISTANT         "start": "func start",
ASSISTANT         "test": "echo \"No tests specified\" && exit 0"
ASSISTANT     },
ASSISTANT     "dependencies": {
ASSISTANT         "@azure/functions": "^3.5.0"
ASSISTANT     },
ASSISTANT     "devDependencies": {
ASSISTANT         "@azure/functions-core": "^3.0.0"
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT `MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`:
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT app.http('MarkdownToSurvey', {
ASSISTANT     methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
ASSISTANT     authLevel: 'function',
ASSISTANT     handler: async (request, context) => {
ASSISTANT         context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
ASSISTANT         
ASSISTANT         const name = request.query.get('name') || await request.text() || 'world';
ASSISTANT         
ASSISTANT         return {
ASSISTANT             body: `Hello, ${name}!`
ASSISTANT         };
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT });
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to create these files in the repository? I'll need you to confirm the exact directory structure you want.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Suggested shell commands:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT npm init -y
ASSISTANT npm install @azure/functions
ASSISTANT ```

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: index.js
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-15T14:35:19
ASSISTANT Based on the context of creating an Azure Function App, we'll want to modify the `index.js` to use the newer Azure Functions v4 programming model with the `@azure/functions` package.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll update the `index.js` to use the modern function definition:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT index.js
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT module.exports = async function (context, req) {
ASSISTANT     context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
ASSISTANT     const responseMessage = name
ASSISTANT         ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
ASSISTANT         : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     context.res = {
ASSISTANT         // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
ASSISTANT         body: responseMessage
ASSISTANT     };
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT app.http('MarkdownToSurvey', {
ASSISTANT     methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
ASSISTANT     authLevel: 'function',
ASSISTANT     handler: async (request, context) => {
ASSISTANT         context.log('Markdown to Survey function processed a request.');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT         const name = request.query.get('name') || await request.text() || 'world';
ASSISTANT         
ASSISTANT         return {
ASSISTANT             body: `Hello, ${name}! This is the Markdown to Survey function.`
ASSISTANT         };
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT });
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also suggest updating the `package.json` to include the necessary Azure Functions dependencies:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT package.json
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "name": "markdown-to-form",
ASSISTANT   "version": "1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "main": "index.js",
ASSISTANT   "directories": {

ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   "scripts": {
ASSISTANT     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   "keywords": [],
ASSISTANT   "author": "",
ASSISTANT   "license": "ISC",
ASSISTANT   "description": ""
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "name": "markdown-to-form",
ASSISTANT   "version": "1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "main": "index.js",
ASSISTANT   "directories": {
ASSISTANT     "doc": "docs"
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   "scripts": {
ASSISTANT     "start": "func start",
ASSISTANT     "test": "echo \"No tests specified\" && exit 0"
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   "keywords": [],
ASSISTANT   "author": "",
ASSISTANT   "license": "ISC",
ASSISTANT   "description": "",
ASSISTANT   "dependencies": {
ASSISTANT     "@azure/functions": "^4.0.0"
ASSISTANT   },
ASSISTANT   "devDependencies": {
ASSISTANT     "azure-functions-core-tools": "^4"
ASSISTANT   }
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Suggested shell commands:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT npm install @azure/functions azure-functions-core-tools@4
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This update does a few key things:
ASSISTANT 1. Uses the modern `@azure/functions` package
ASSISTANT 2. Switches to the new function definition style
ASSISTANT 3. Adds necessary dependencies to `package.json`
ASSISTANT 4. Keeps a similar logging and response structure
ASSISTANT 5. Prepares the function for future Markdown to Survey conversion logic
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to elaborate on any of these changes?
TO LLM 2024-11-15T14:35:32

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-15
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math

## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We created several key files including `index.js`, `package.json`, and previously discussed `host.json` and `local.settings.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js, and the function is currently set up with a basic HTTP trigger that logs requests and returns a simple greeting. The project is structured for an Azure Function App, and we've prepared the initial DevOps setup to connect the GitHub repository to the Azure Function App deployment.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-15
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

The project is structured for an Azure Function App, and we've prepared the initial DevOps setup to connect the GitHub repository to the Azure Function App deployment.

ASSISTANT I've updated the package.json to:
ASSISTANT 1. Add a "start" script for running the Azure Function locally
ASSISTANT 2. Modify the test script to be less error-prone
ASSISTANT 3. Add azure-functions-core-tools as a dev dependency
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Suggested shell command to install the new dev dependency:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT npm install --save-dev azure-functions-core-tools@4
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER Do I need to create a `function.json` in the `MarkdownToSurvey` like this?
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-15T22:09:30
ASSISTANT Yes, for an Azure Function using the v4 programming model with `@azure/functions`, you typically need a `function.json` file in the function's directory. Here's a standard configuration for an HTTP-triggered function:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "request",
ASSISTANT             "methods": [
ASSISTANT                 "get",
ASSISTANT                 "post"
ASSISTANT             ]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "response"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This configuration matches the settings in your `index.js`:
ASSISTANT - Uses function-level authentication
ASSISTANT - Supports GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input and output bindings for HTTP requests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Suggested shell command to verify the function setup:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT func start
ASSISTANT ```

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-15
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We created several key files including `index.js`, `package.json`, and previously discussed `host.json` and `local.settings.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js, and I added some new scripts to the `package.json`, including a "start" script for running the Azure Function locally and updated the dev dependencies to include `azure-functions-core-tools`. The project is structured for an Azure Function App, and we've prepared the initial DevOps setup to connect the GitHub repository to the Azure Function App deployment.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER Do I need to create a `function.json` in the `MarkdownToSurvey` like this?

ASSISTANT Yes, for an Azure Function using the v4 programming model with `@azure/functions`, you typically need a `function.json` file in the function's directory. Here's a standard configuration for an HTTP-triggered function:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "request",
ASSISTANT             "methods": [
ASSISTANT                 "get",
ASSISTANT                 "post"
ASSISTANT             ]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "response"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This configuration matches the settings in your `index.js`:
ASSISTANT - Uses function-level authentication
ASSISTANT - Supports GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input and output bindings for HTTP requests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Suggested shell command to verify the function setup:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT func start
ASSISTANT ```

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Move `index.js` into the `MarkdownToSurvey/` directory
ASSISTANT 2. Create a `host.json` file
ASSISTANT 3. Install Azure Functions Core Tools
ASSISTANT 4. Set up local development environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the steps:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Move `index.js`:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create `host.json`:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will set up a local development environment for your Azure Function. The function should now be accessible at `http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps?
TO LLM 2024-11-16T09:30:44

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T09:30:51
ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?
TO LLM 2024-11-16T09:39:17

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*
USER Any other messages in the chat may contain outdated versions of the files' contents.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER {
USER     "bindings": [
USER         {
USER             "authLevel": "function",
USER             "type": "httpTrigger",

USER         },
USER         {

USER             "name": "response"
USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.
USER 
LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T09:40:01
ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?
TO LLM 2024-11-16T09:40:22

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER {
USER     "bindings": [
USER         {
USER             "authLevel": "function",

USER         {

USER             "direction": "out",
USER             "name": "response"
USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER {
USER     "bindings": [
USER         {
USER             "authLevel": "function",

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.
USER 
LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T09:40:26
ASSISTANT I noticed you repeated the same file content for `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move forward, could you add these additional files to the chat:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 3. `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will help me review the entire project structure and provide more comprehensive guidance.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to share the contents of those files?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER     "bindings": [
USER         {

USER             "name": "response"
USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json

USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I noticed you repeated the same file content for `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move forward, could you add these additional files to the chat:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 3. `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will help me review the entire project structure and provide more comprehensive guidance.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to share the contents of those files?

USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*
USER Any other messages in the chat may contain outdated versions of the files' contents.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json

USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I noticed you repeated the same file content for `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move forward, could you add these additional files to the chat:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 3. `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will help me review the entire project structure and provide more comprehensive guidance.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to share the contents of those files?

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I apologize for the confusion. It seems like you're repeatedly adding the same `function.json` file to the chat. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To help you effectively, could you please:
ASSISTANT 1. Confirm which specific files you want me to review
ASSISTANT 2. Provide the contents of those files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The files I'm most interested in reviewing are:
ASSISTANT - `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT - `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT - `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you mind sharing the contents of these files?

USER Can you see the files now? Do you need access to any additional files?
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json

USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I noticed you repeated the same file content for `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move forward, could you add these additional files to the chat:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 3. `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will help me review the entire project structure and provide more comprehensive guidance.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to share the contents of those files?

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T09:47:27
ASSISTANT I see you've added the files to the chat. Based on the files you've shared, the project structure looks good and follows Azure Functions best practices. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's a summary of the current setup:
ASSISTANT 1. `index.js` is a basic HTTP-triggered Azure Function using the `@azure/functions` package
ASSISTANT 2. `function.json` correctly defines HTTP trigger and response bindings
ASSISTANT 3. `package.json` has the necessary dependencies and scripts
ASSISTANT 4. `host.json` is configured with standard Azure Functions settings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The current implementation is a simple "Hello World" style function that:
ASSISTANT - Accepts GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Logs a request
ASSISTANT - Returns a greeting with an optional name parameter
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to:
ASSISTANT 1. Enhance the function's functionality?
ASSISTANT 2. Add error handling?
ASSISTANT 3. Prepare for Markdown to Survey conversion logic?
ASSISTANT 4. Something else?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please provide guidance on what specific improvements or changes you'd like to make to the Azure Function.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json

USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I noticed you repeated the same file content for `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move forward, could you add these additional files to the chat:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 3. `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will help me review the entire project structure and provide more comprehensive guidance.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to share the contents of those files?

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the files to the chat. Based on the files you've shared, the project structure looks good and follows Azure Functions best practices. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's a summary of the current setup:
ASSISTANT 1. `index.js` is a basic HTTP-triggered Azure Function using the `@azure/functions` package
ASSISTANT 2. `function.json` correctly defines HTTP trigger and response bindings
ASSISTANT 3. `package.json` has the necessary dependencies and scripts
ASSISTANT 4. `host.json` is configured with standard Azure Functions settings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The current implementation is a simple "Hello World" style function that:
ASSISTANT - Accepts GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Logs a request
ASSISTANT - Returns a greeting with an optional name parameter
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to:
ASSISTANT 1. Enhance the function's functionality?
ASSISTANT 2. Add error handling?
ASSISTANT 3. Prepare for Markdown to Survey conversion logic?
ASSISTANT 4. Something else?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please provide guidance on what specific improvements or changes you'd like to make to the Azure Function.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T09:47:44
ASSISTANT I noticed you've shared the same files again and included the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* rules. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT It seems like you want me to help you with the Azure Function. Based on the current `index.js`, the function is a basic "Hello World" style implementation. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move towards a Markdown to Survey conversion, we'll need to:
ASSISTANT 1. Add markdown parsing capability
ASSISTANT 2. Add survey generation logic
ASSISTANT 3. Implement error handling
ASSISTANT 4. Add input validation
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to propose changes to `index.js` to start implementing these features? 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I recommend adding these dependencies to `package.json`:
ASSISTANT - `marked` for markdown parsing
ASSISTANT - `uuid` for generating unique survey IDs
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Shall I propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to update the `package.json` with these dependencies?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. The project is now structured for an Azure Function App, and we're preparing to test the local development environment and potentially deploy it through our DevOps setup.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I saw that it appears that `MarkdownToSurvey` should be used as the project root. Is that correct? You got the error that `host.json` should be in the project root so you tried to run this ```cd MarkdownToSurvey         
USER npm install @azure/functions
USER func start  ```, moving the node_modules into `MarkdownToSurvey`? So, what I did is just move the whole `node_modules/` and `package.json` into `MarkdownToSurvey/`. Is that wrong? I want to clean up vestigial code if we intend to restructure the app. What is the best tree structure? Can you scetch the tree structure in ASCII?

ASSISTANT Based on Azure Functions best practices and the context of your Markdown to Survey project, here's a recommended project structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── src/
ASSISTANT │   └── functions/
ASSISTANT │       └── MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT │           ├── index.js
ASSISTANT │           └── function.json
ASSISTANT │
ASSISTANT ├── host.json
ASSISTANT ├── local.settings.json
ASSISTANT ├── package.json
ASSISTANT └── node_modules/
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Key points:
ASSISTANT 1. `src/functions/` is the standard location for Azure Function source code
ASSISTANT 2. Each function gets its own subdirectory
ASSISTANT 3. `host.json` and `local.settings.json` remain in the root
ASSISTANT 4. `package.json` and `node_modules/` also stay in the root
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Recommended shell commands to restructure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Create directory structure
ASSISTANT mkdir -p MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Move existing files
ASSISTANT mv index.js MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv function.json MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv package.json MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT mv node_modules MarkdownToSurvey/
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Verify structure
ASSISTANT tree MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you implement this structure?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER .
USER ├── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │   ├── host.json
USER │   ├── package-lock.json
USER │   ├── package.json
USER │   └── src
USER │       └── functions
USER │           └── MarkdownToSurvey
USER │               ├── function.json
USER │               └── index.js
USER ├── create-function.ipynb
USER └── docs
USER     └── coding_standards.md
USER 
USER 5 directories, 7 files
USER 

ASSISTANT Great! The current structure looks very close to the recommended best practice. The only potential improvement I see is ensuring that `function.json` follows Azure Functions conventions for configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's verify the contents of `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Could you share the current contents of that file? I want to ensure it's configured correctly for an HTTP-triggered Azure Function.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A typical `function.json` for an HTTP trigger might look like:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```json
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT     "bindings": [
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "authLevel": "function",
ASSISTANT             "type": "httpTrigger",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "in",
ASSISTANT             "name": "req",
ASSISTANT             "methods": ["get", "post"]
ASSISTANT         },
ASSISTANT         {
ASSISTANT             "type": "http",
ASSISTANT             "direction": "out",
ASSISTANT             "name": "$return"
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT     ]
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you update the `function.json` if it doesn't match this structure?

USER         }
USER     ]
USER }
USER 
USER 
USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json` file to the chat. The current configuration looks good and follows Azure Functions conventions for an HTTP-triggered function. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration includes:
ASSISTANT - `authLevel`: "function" (requires a function key)
ASSISTANT - `type`: "httpTrigger"
ASSISTANT - Supports both GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Defines input (`request`) and output (`response`) bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No changes are needed to this file. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to review or suggest improvements to any other files in the project? Specifically, I'm interested in:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to add those files to the chat for review?

USER Output from cat MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json

USER 

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I noticed you repeated the same file content for `MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move forward, could you add these additional files to the chat:
ASSISTANT 1. `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
ASSISTANT 2. `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
ASSISTANT 3. `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will help me review the entire project structure and provide more comprehensive guidance.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like to share the contents of those files?

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see you've added the files to the chat. Based on the files you've shared, the project structure looks good and follows Azure Functions best practices. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's a summary of the current setup:
ASSISTANT 1. `index.js` is a basic HTTP-triggered Azure Function using the `@azure/functions` package
ASSISTANT 2. `function.json` correctly defines HTTP trigger and response bindings
ASSISTANT 3. `package.json` has the necessary dependencies and scripts
ASSISTANT 4. `host.json` is configured with standard Azure Functions settings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The current implementation is a simple "Hello World" style function that:
ASSISTANT - Accepts GET and POST methods
ASSISTANT - Logs a request
ASSISTANT - Returns a greeting with an optional name parameter
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to:
ASSISTANT 1. Enhance the function's functionality?
ASSISTANT 2. Add error handling?
ASSISTANT 3. Prepare for Markdown to Survey conversion logic?
ASSISTANT 4. Something else?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please provide guidance on what specific improvements or changes you'd like to make to the Azure Function.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT Would you like me to propose changes to `index.js` to start implementing these features? 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I recommend adding these dependencies to `package.json`:
ASSISTANT - `marked` for markdown parsing
ASSISTANT - `uuid` for generating unique survey IDs
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Shall I propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to update the `package.json` with these dependencies?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll summarize the conversation from my perspective:
USER 
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. 
USER 
USER The project is now structured with a typical Azure Functions layout:
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
USER 
USER The current `index.js` is a basic HTTP-triggered function that returns a simple greeting. We're now looking to enhance its functionality to support Markdown to Survey conversion.
USER 
USER Would you like to proceed with developing the core conversion logic?

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T09:51:02
ASSISTANT To test the Azure Function locally, you'll want to use the Azure Functions Core Tools. Based on your `package.json`, you already have a script set up:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cd MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT npm start
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This command will start the local Azure Functions runtime. The function should be accessible locally, typically at `http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT You can test it using:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Using curl
ASSISTANT curl http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Or using httpie
ASSISTANT http http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A few things to note:
ASSISTANT 1. Make sure you're in the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory when running these commands
ASSISTANT 2. Ensure Azure Functions Core Tools is installed globally
ASSISTANT 3. The current implementation will return a simple greeting
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to modify the `index.js` to add more robust Markdown to Survey conversion logic?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")

ASSISTANT text: Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll summarize the conversation from my perspective:
USER 
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, including creating key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and updating the `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added scripts to run the Azure Function locally. 
USER 
USER The project is now structured with a typical Azure Functions layout:
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/function.json`
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/package.json`
USER - `MarkdownToSurvey/host.json`
USER 
USER The current `index.js` is a basic HTTP-triggered function that returns a simple greeting. We're now looking to enhance its functionality to support Markdown to Survey conversion.
USER 
USER Would you like to proceed with developing the core conversion logic?

ASSISTANT Ok

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/function.json
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I noticed you've shared the same files again and included the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* rules. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT It seems like you want me to help you with the Azure Function. Based on the current `index.js`, the function is a basic "Hello World" style implementation. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To move towards a Markdown to Survey conversion, we'll need to:
ASSISTANT 1. Add markdown parsing capability
ASSISTANT 2. Add survey generation logic
ASSISTANT 3. Implement error handling
ASSISTANT 4. Add input validation
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to propose changes to `index.js` to start implementing these features? 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I recommend adding these dependencies to `package.json`:
ASSISTANT - `marked` for markdown parsing
ASSISTANT - `uuid` for generating unique survey IDs
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Shall I propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to update the `package.json` with these dependencies?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:

ASSISTANT Ok

USER Do we have everything we need now to test the function?

ASSISTANT To test the Azure Function locally, you'll want to use the Azure Functions Core Tools. Based on your `package.json`, you already have a script set up:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cd MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT npm start
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This command will start the local Azure Functions runtime. The function should be accessible locally, typically at `http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT You can test it using:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Using curl
ASSISTANT curl http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Or using httpie
ASSISTANT http http://localhost:7071/api/MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A few things to note:
ASSISTANT 1. Make sure you're in the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory when running these commands
ASSISTANT 2. Ensure Azure Functions Core Tools is installed globally
ASSISTANT 3. The current implementation will return a simple greeting
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to modify the `index.js` to add more robust Markdown to Survey conversion logic?

USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH

USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about setting up an Azure Function App for our Markdown to Survey project. We've been working on configuring the project structure, which now includes key files like `index.js`, `function.json`, `host.json`, and an updated `package.json`. We're using the `@azure/functions` package with Node.js and have added new dependencies like `marked` and `uuid`.
USER 
USER The project is structured with a typical Azure Functions layout in the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory. We've installed the necessary npm packages and are now ready to test the local Azure Function using the `npm start` command.
USER 
USER The current `index.js` is a basic HTTP-triggered function that returns a simple greeting, and we're preparing to enhance its functionality to support Markdown to Survey conversion.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER There were some serious configuration issues, all having to do with your misunderstanding of the file tree. You tried several times to add files that didn't exist. You should have a map of the file structure, but run `pwd` and ` tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'` if you have any questions. Your `pacakge.json` `start` script, for instance, started with `cd MarkdownToSurvey && function start`, but the `package.json` is in the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory. There is the additional confusion of having two `MarkdownToSurvey` segments in the `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js` path. What are the names of the two segments? Is the outer one the `Function App` and the inner one the `function`? I would like to talk about how to make them unique. I've edited the `package.json` and a couple other files, so don't edit them without getting the latest version. Now, if I navigate to `markdown-to-form/MarkdownToSurvey/` and run `npm start`, I get this: 
USER ```sh
USER  npm start
USER 
USER > markdown-to-form@1.0.0 start
USER > func start

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T10:51:49
ASSISTANT Let me clarify the directory structure and naming:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Outer `MarkdownToSurvey`: This is the Function App directory
ASSISTANT 2. Inner `MarkdownToSurvey`: This is the specific function within the Function App
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To make these more unique, I suggest renaming the inner directory to reflect its specific purpose. For example, `markdown-survey-converter`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For deployment, we'll want to use Azure CLI. Here are the steps I recommend:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Verify Azure CLI is installed and you're logged in:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT az --version
ASSISTANT az login
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Confirm the resource group and function app exist:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT az functionapp list --query "[].{name: name, resourceGroup: resourceGroup}" --output table
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 3. Set up deployment credentials:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT az functionapp deployment source config-local-git --name markdown-to-form --resource-group markdowntosurvey
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you proceed with deployment? Do you want to rename the inner directory first?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.

ASSISTANT I see the issue now. The workflow file already has a `workflow_dispatch:` trigger on line 8, so the error message seems contradictory. However, I notice there's a placeholder `__environment__` on the deploy job which looks like it might be causing an issue.

ASSISTANT I'll propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* to fix the `__environment__` line:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     __environment__
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     environment: production
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change replaces the placeholder with a valid GitHub Actions environment configuration. The `environment: production` line specifies that this job will run in a production environment.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, the workflow should be valid and allow manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`.

USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH

USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T22:32:17
ASSISTANT I noticed that the workflow runs are marked with [0;31mX[0m, which typically indicates failed runs. This could be related to the deployment issue you mentioned earlier.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's try to diagnose the problem by looking at the workflow file more closely. The current configuration looks mostly correct, with a `workflow_dispatch` trigger present and an `environment: production` set.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to:
ASSISTANT 1. Verify the workflow file's syntax
ASSISTANT 2. Check the specific error messages from the failed runs
ASSISTANT 3. Suggest any potential modifications to the workflow
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Which would you prefer I focus on first?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file syntax

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py

USER I have pushed this latest code to the GitHub remote, which is connected to thisAzure Function App. When I try to sync the Function App in the Azure web GUI, I get this error:
USER ```
USER Failed to redeploy: Redeployment failed because your workflow file in your repository does not have a 'workflow_dispatch' trigger. To fix, add the 'workflow_dispatch' trigger to the workflow file under 
USER ```

ASSISTANT Based on the error message, the file most likely to need changes is:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This is the GitHub Actions workflow file that needs a 'workflow_dispatch' trigger added to allow manual triggering of the workflow from the GitHub web interface or via API.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please add this file to the chat so I can help you modify it.

USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I see the issue now. The workflow file already has a `workflow_dispatch:` trigger on line 8, so the error message seems contradictory. However, I notice there's a placeholder `__environment__` on the deploy job which looks like it might be causing an issue.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* to fix the `__environment__` line:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     __environment__
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     environment: production
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change replaces the placeholder with a valid GitHub Actions environment configuration. The `environment: production` line specifies that this job will run in a production environment.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, the workflow should be valid and allow manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest any shell commands to verify or test this change?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

USER 

ASSISTANT I noticed that the workflow runs are marked with [0;31mX[0m, which typically indicates failed runs. This could be related to the deployment issue you mentioned earlier.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's try to diagnose the problem by looking at the workflow file more closely. The current configuration looks mostly correct, with a `workflow_dispatch` trigger present and an `environment: production` set.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to:
ASSISTANT 1. Verify the workflow file's syntax
ASSISTANT 2. Check the specific error messages from the failed runs
ASSISTANT 3. Suggest any potential modifications to the workflow
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Which would you prefer I focus on first?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file syntax
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml --yaml
ASSISTANT ```

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T22:38:10
ASSISTANT I see the issue now. There's a placeholder `__environment__` on the deploy job that needs to be replaced with the correct environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* to fix this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     __environment__
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     environment: production
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change replaces the placeholder with a valid GitHub Actions environment configuration. The `environment: production` line specifies that this job will run in a production environment.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to validate the workflow?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about your GitHub Actions workflow file for your Azure Function App deployment. The workflow file looks mostly correct, but I noticed a placeholder `__environment__` line in the deploy job that might be causing issues. 
USER 
USER The workflow is configured to:
USER - Trigger on push to master branch
USER - Support manual workflow dispatch
USER - Use Node.js 20.x
USER - Build the project with npm
USER - Create a zip artifact
USER - Deploy to an Azure Function App named 'markdown-to-form'
USER 
USER The key issue appears to be the `__environment__` line, which should be replaced with a proper environment configuration like `environment: production`. 
USER 
USER Would you like me to help you modify the workflow file to resolve any potential deployment problems?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml --yaml
USER 
USER And got this output:

USER 

ASSISTANT I see the issue now. There's a placeholder `__environment__` on the deploy job that needs to be replaced with the correct environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* to fix this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     __environment__
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     environment: production
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change replaces the placeholder with a valid GitHub Actions environment configuration. The `environment: production` line specifies that this job will run in a production environment.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to validate the workflow?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT You're absolutely right. The `environment: production` line is already present in the file, so no SEARCH/REPLACE block is needed. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Is there something specific you would like me to help you with regarding this GitHub Actions workflow file?
TO LLM 2024-11-16T22:51:00

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about your GitHub Actions workflow file for your Azure Function App deployment. The workflow file looks mostly correct, but I noticed a placeholder `__environment__` line in the deploy job that might be causing issues. 
USER 
USER The workflow is configured to:
USER - Trigger on push to master branch
USER - Support manual workflow dispatch
USER - Use Node.js 20.x
USER - Build the project with npm
USER - Create a zip artifact
USER - Deploy to an Azure Function App named 'markdown-to-form'
USER 
USER The key issue appears to be the `__environment__` line, which should be replaced with a proper environment configuration like `environment: production`. 
USER 
USER Would you like me to help you modify the workflow file to resolve any potential deployment problems?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml --yaml
USER 
USER And got this output:

USER 

ASSISTANT I see the issue now. There's a placeholder `__environment__` on the deploy job that needs to be replaced with the correct environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll propose a *SEARCH/REPLACE* to fix this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     __environment__
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     environment: production
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change replaces the placeholder with a valid GitHub Actions environment configuration. The `environment: production` line specifies that this job will run in a production environment.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to validate the workflow?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER 
USER Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?
USER The REPLACE lines are already in .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml!
USER 
USER The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

ASSISTANT You're absolutely right. The `environment: production` line is already present in the file, so no SEARCH/REPLACE block is needed.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T22:51:10
ASSISTANT The error suggests that the GitHub Actions workflow is looking for a `package.json` file in the root directory, but it's actually located in the `MarkdownToSurvey` subdirectory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll modify the workflow file to change the package path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: '.' # set this to the path to your web app project, defaults to the repository root
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: 'MarkdownToSurvey' # set this to the path to your web app project
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change updates the package path to point to the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory where the `package.json` is located.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also modify the npm install step to ensure it's in the correct directory:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           pushd './${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           npm install
ASSISTANT           npm run build --if-present
ASSISTANT           npm run test --if-present
ASSISTANT           popd
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           npm install
ASSISTANT           npm run build --if-present
ASSISTANT           npm run test --if-present
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I replaced `pushd` and `popd` with a simple `cd` to change into the correct directory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Lastly, I'll modify the zip and artifact steps to respect the new package path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: zip release.zip ./* -r
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip .
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the npm install and artifact creation issues by ensuring the workflow operates in the correct directory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to test the workflow locally?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about a GitHub Actions workflow file for an Azure Function App deployment. The workflow is configured to build and deploy a Node.js project to a Function App named 'markdown-to-form'. 
USER 
USER The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml` and includes steps for:
USER - Triggering on push to the master branch
USER - Supporting manual workflow dispatch
USER - Using Node.js 20.x
USER - Resolving project dependencies with npm
USER - Creating a zip artifact
USER - Deploying to the Azure Function App
USER 
USER When I initially thought there was an issue with an `__environment__` placeholder, you pointed out that the environment configuration was already correctly set to `environment: production`. There are no further modifications needed to the workflow file at this time.

USER When I commit this code and push to the remote, I get this:

ASSISTANT The error suggests that the GitHub Actions workflow is looking for a `package.json` file in the root directory, but it's actually located in the `MarkdownToSurvey` subdirectory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll modify the workflow file to change the package path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: '.' # set this to the path to your web app project, defaults to the repository root
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: 'MarkdownToSurvey' # set this to the path to your web app project
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change updates the package path to point to the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory where the `package.json` is located.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also modify the npm install step to ensure it's in the correct directory:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           pushd './${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           npm install
ASSISTANT           npm run build --if-present
ASSISTANT           npm run test --if-present
ASSISTANT           popd
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           npm install
ASSISTANT           npm run build --if-present
ASSISTANT           npm run test --if-present
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I replaced `pushd` and `popd` with a simple `cd` to change into the correct directory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Lastly, I'll modify the zip and artifact steps to respect the new package path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: zip release.zip ./* -r
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip .
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the npm install and artifact creation issues by ensuring the workflow operates in the correct directory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to test the workflow locally?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH

USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:

ASSISTANT 3. Set the package path to 'MarkdownToSurvey'
ASSISTANT 4. Install dependencies
ASSISTANT 5. Create a zip artifact
ASSISTANT 6. Deploy to Azure Function App 'markdown-to-form'
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Is there something specific you'd like me to review or modify?
TO LLM 2024-11-16T23:04:39

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-16
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about a GitHub Actions workflow file for an Azure Function App deployment. The workflow is configured to build and deploy a Node.js project to a Function App named 'markdown-to-form'. 
USER 
USER The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml` and includes steps for:
USER - Triggering on push to the master branch
USER - Supporting manual workflow dispatch
USER - Using Node.js 20.x
USER - Resolving project dependencies with npm
USER - Creating a zip artifact
USER - Deploying to the Azure Function App
USER 
USER When I initially thought there was an issue with an `__environment__` placeholder, you pointed out that the environment configuration was already correctly set to `environment: production`. There are no further modifications needed to the workflow file at this time.

USER When I commit this code and push to the remote, I get this:

ASSISTANT The error suggests that the GitHub Actions workflow is looking for a `package.json` file in the root directory, but it's actually located in the `MarkdownToSurvey` subdirectory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll modify the workflow file to change the package path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT   AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: '.' # set this to the path to your web app project, defaults to the repository root
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT   AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: 'MarkdownToSurvey' # set this to the path to your web app project
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change updates the package path to point to the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory where the `package.json` is located.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also modify the npm install step to ensure it's in the correct directory:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           pushd './${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           npm install
ASSISTANT           npm run build --if-present
ASSISTANT           npm run test --if-present
ASSISTANT           popd
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           npm install
ASSISTANT           npm run build --if-present
ASSISTANT           npm run test --if-present
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I replaced `pushd` and `popd` with a simple `cd` to change into the correct directory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Lastly, I'll modify the zip and artifact steps to respect the new package path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: zip release.zip ./* -r
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip .
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the npm install and artifact creation issues by ensuring the workflow operates in the correct directory.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to test the workflow locally?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-16T23:04:49
ASSISTANT The error suggests that during the deployment step, the workflow cannot find the 'MarkdownToSurvey' directory. This is likely because the unzip step is not preserving the directory structure.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's modify the workflow file to ensure the directory structure is maintained:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Unzip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: unzip release.zip
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Unzip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: unzip release.zip -d MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will unzip the contents into a 'MarkdownToSurvey' directory, which should match the package path specified in the deployment step.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, let's modify the zip creation step to ensure the correct directory structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip .
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip ./*
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The change from `zip -r ../release.zip .` to `zip -r ../release.zip ./*` ensures that all files and subdirectories are included in the zip.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Lastly, let's update the package path in the deployment step to use the unzipped directory:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT           package: ${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT           package: './MarkdownToSurvey'
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should help resolve the "cannot find 'MarkdownToSurvey'" error by:
ASSISTANT 1. Unzipping the artifact into a 'MarkdownToSurvey' directory
ASSISTANT 2. Ensuring all files are included in the zip
ASSISTANT 3. Specifying the correct package path for deployment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to test this?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about the GitHub Actions workflow for my Azure Function App deployment. We previously modified the workflow file located at `.github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml` to address an issue with the package path. The key changes we made were:
USER 
USER 1. Setting `AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH` to 'MarkdownToSurvey'
USER 2. Modifying the npm install steps to use the correct directory
USER 3. Updating the zip artifact creation to work from the correct subdirectory
USER 
USER The workflow is now configured to work with the project structure, using Node.js 20.x and targeting the Azure Function App named 'markdown-to-form'. I ran the `gh workflow view` command to check the workflow details, and everything appears to be in order.

USER I get this error:

USER ```

ASSISTANT The error suggests that during the deployment step, the workflow cannot find the 'MarkdownToSurvey' directory. This is likely because the unzip step is not preserving the directory structure.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's modify the workflow file to ensure the directory structure is maintained:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Unzip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: unzip release.zip
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Unzip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: unzip release.zip -d MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will unzip the contents into a 'MarkdownToSurvey' directory, which should match the package path specified in the deployment step.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, let's modify the zip creation step to ensure the correct directory structure:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip .
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT       - name: Zip artifact for deployment
ASSISTANT         run: |
ASSISTANT           cd '${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}'
ASSISTANT           zip -r ../release.zip ./*
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The change from `zip -r ../release.zip .` to `zip -r ../release.zip ./*` ensures that all files and subdirectories are included in the zip.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Lastly, let's update the package path in the deployment step to use the unzipped directory:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT .github/workflows/master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT           package: ${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT           package: './MarkdownToSurvey'
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should help resolve the "cannot find 'MarkdownToSurvey'" error by:
ASSISTANT 1. Unzipping the artifact into a 'MarkdownToSurvey' directory
ASSISTANT 2. Ensuring all files are included in the zip
ASSISTANT 3. Specifying the correct package path for deployment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest a shell command to test this?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Validate the GitHub Actions workflow file
ASSISTANT gh workflow view master_markdown-to-form.yml
ASSISTANT ```

USER I updated the files.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-17T00:03:13
ASSISTANT The `function.json` already has `"authLevel": "anonymous"`, which should allow unauthenticated access. This suggests the issue might be in the Azure Function App configuration or the function's implementation.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's check the `index.js` file to ensure the function is correctly handling requests:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT const { app } = require('@azure/functions');

ASSISTANT module.exports = async function (context, request) {
ASSISTANT     context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     const name = (request.query.name || (request.body && request.body.name));
ASSISTANT     const responseMessage = name
ASSISTANT         ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
ASSISTANT         : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     context.res = {
ASSISTANT         // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
ASSISTANT         body: responseMessage
ASSISTANT     };
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT module.exports = async function (context, request) {
ASSISTANT     context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     const name = (request.query.name || (request.body && request.body.name));
ASSISTANT     const responseMessage = name
ASSISTANT         ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."

ASSISTANT         status: 200,

ASSISTANT     };
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The key change is explicitly setting `status: 200` to ensure a successful response. 
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also suggest checking the Azure Function App configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Verify Function App settings
ASSISTANT az functionapp config show --name markdown-to-form --resource-group <your-resource-group>
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Check authentication settings
ASSISTANT az functionapp auth show --name markdown-to-form --resource-group <your-resource-group>
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Replace `<your-resource-group>` with the actual resource group name.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The 401 Unauthorized error could be caused by:
ASSISTANT 1. Incorrect authentication settings in the Azure Function App
ASSISTANT 2. Network restrictions
ASSISTANT 3. Misconfigured function bindings
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you investigate further?
TO LLM 2024-11-17T00:03:17

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To help me understand, could you show me the exact current contents of the file? This will allow me to create a precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* block that exactly matches the existing code.

USER ```js
USER const { app } = require('@azure/functions');

USER ```
USER So, you attempted edit failed because you seemed to be editing different content.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The key changes are:

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I've made several key changes:
ASSISTANT 1. In the HTTP request file, I updated the header to use `x-functions-key` which is the standard way to pass function keys.
ASSISTANT 2. In `index.js`, I've added a `parseMarkdownToForm` function that:
ASSISTANT    - Reads the `UserSurvey.md` file
ASSISTANT    - Uses `marked` to parse the Markdown
ASSISTANT    - Extracts form title from H1
ASSISTANT    - Extracts questions from H2 headings
ASSISTANT    - Detects multiple-choice questions from unordered lists
ASSISTANT    - Returns a structured JSON representation of the form
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Suggested shell commands:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # Install marked package if not already installed
ASSISTANT npm install marked
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Test the function locally
ASSISTANT func start
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to create a sample `UserSurvey.md` to demonstrate the parsing?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll summarize our recent conversation:
USER 
USER I asked you about updating the Azure Function App deployment. We modified the `markdown-to-form.http` file to use the `_master` key for authentication, and I created a new version of `index.js` that includes a Markdown parsing function. The new function uses the `marked` library to convert a Markdown file into a structured JSON representation of a survey form. 
USER 
USER The parsing logic looks for:
USER - H1 as the form title
USER - H2 as question titles
USER - Unordered lists as multiple-choice options
USER 
USER I suggested installing the `marked` package and testing the function locally using `func start`. The function will read `UserSurvey.md` from the project directory and return a JSON structure describing the survey form.
USER 
USER Would you like me to provide a sample `UserSurvey.md` to demonstrate the parsing capabilities?

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.
USER 
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*

USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python

USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also suggest a shell command to verify the function locally:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cd MarkdownToSurvey && func start
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This sample `UserSurvey.md` demonstrates the parsing logic you described:
ASSISTANT - H1 (first heading) becomes the form title
ASSISTANT - H2 headings become question titles
ASSISTANT - Unordered lists become multiple-choice options
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The function should parse this and return a JSON structure with the survey form details.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to make any adjustments to the sample markdown?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py

USER 
USER I asked you about updating the Azure Function App deployment. We modified the `markdown-to-form.http` file to use the `_master` key for authentication, and I created a new version of `index.js` that includes a Markdown parsing function.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This sample `UserSurvey.md` demonstrates the parsing logic you described:
ASSISTANT - H1 (first heading) becomes the form title
ASSISTANT - H2 headings become question titles
ASSISTANT - Unordered lists become multiple-choice options
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The function should parse this and return a JSON structure with the survey form details.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to make any adjustments to the sample markdown?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll summarize our recent conversation:
USER 
USER I asked you about updating an Azure Function App to parse Markdown files into survey form structures. We discussed creating a function in `index.js` that uses the `marked` library to convert a Markdown file into a JSON representation. You installed the `marked` package and showed me the project directory structure, which includes a `MarkdownToSurvey` folder with the Azure Function and a `UserSurvey.md` file in the root directory.
USER 
USER I suggested a sample `UserSurvey.md` file that demonstrates the parsing capabilities, with a structure that includes:
USER - A form title as an H1
USER - Questions as H2 headings
USER - Multiple-choice options as unordered lists
USER 
USER You were experiencing an issue running the function locally with `func start`, which reported an inability to find the project root. I recommended running the command from within the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory.
USER 
USER Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the local function startup?

USER I ran this command:
USER

ASSISTANT I see the UserSurvey.md is now located in the `src/test/` directory. I'll update the `index.js` to reflect this new path:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'll also create the UserSurvey.md in the correct location:

ASSISTANT Based on the directory structure, the code looks good. The function is set up to read the `UserSurvey.md` file from the correct path (`src/test/UserSurvey.md`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you test the function or make any specific improvements? Some potential enhancements could include:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Adding error handling for missing markdown file
ASSISTANT 2. Supporting dynamic markdown file input via HTTP request
ASSISTANT 3. Adding more robust parsing for different markdown structures
ASSISTANT 4. Adding input validation
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT What specific improvements or testing would you like to focus on?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py

<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I'll summarize our recent conversation:
USER 
USER I asked you about updating an Azure Function App to parse Markdown files into survey form structures. We discussed creating a function in `index.js` that uses the `marked` library to convert a Markdown file into a JSON representation. You installed the `marked` package and showed me the project directory structure, which includes a `MarkdownToSurvey` folder with the Azure Function and a `UserSurvey.md` file in the root directory.
USER 
USER I suggested a sample `UserSurvey.md` file that demonstrates the parsing capabilities, with a structure that includes:
USER - A form title as an H1
USER - Questions as H2 headings
USER - Multiple-choice options as unordered lists
USER 
USER You were experiencing an issue running the function locally with `func start`, which reported an inability to find the project root. I recommended running the command from within the `MarkdownToSurvey` directory.
USER 
USER Would you like me to help you troubleshoot the local function startup?

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER tree -L 5 -I 'node_modules/'
USER 
USER And got this output:

ASSISTANT I see the UserSurvey.md is now located in the `src/test/` directory. I'll update the `index.js` to reflect this new path:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT             const surveyPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', '..', 'UserSurvey.md');
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT             const surveyPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', 'test', 'UserSurvey.md');

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes update the file path in the Azure Function to correctly locate the UserSurvey.md file in the new directory structure, and create a sample survey markdown file in the correct location.

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER 

ASSISTANT Based on the directory structure, the code looks good. The function is set up to read the `UserSurvey.md` file from the correct path (`src/test/UserSurvey.md`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to help you test the function or make any specific improvements? Some potential enhancements could include:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Adding error handling for missing markdown file
ASSISTANT 2. Supporting dynamic markdown file input via HTTP request
ASSISTANT 3. Adding more robust parsing for different markdown structures
ASSISTANT 4. Adding input validation
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT What specific improvements or testing would you like to focus on?

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/src/test/UserSurvey.md
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about updating an Azure Function App to parse Markdown files into survey form structures. We discussed creating a function in `index.js` that uses the `marked` library to convert a Markdown file into a JSON representation. 
USER 
USER I showed you the project directory structure, which includes a `MarkdownToSurvey` folder with the Azure Function and a `UserSurvey.md` file now located in the `src/test/` directory. We updated the file path in the `index.js` to correctly locate the markdown file and created a sample survey markdown file.
USER 
USER The current project structure includes the Azure Function in `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js`, with a sample markdown survey file at `MarkdownToSurvey/src/test/UserSurvey.md`. 
USER 
USER I'm now asking you about potential improvements or testing approaches for the markdown-to-survey parsing function.

USER I added these files to the chat: MarkdownToSurvey/src/test/UserSurvey.md
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.

ASSISTANT I notice the UserSurvey.md has a more complex structure than our previous simple example. I'll update the `index.js` to handle this more nuanced markdown parsing:

USER Currently, the function is expecting the markdown form to be available in the same directory:
USER ```js
USER         const markdownContent = await fs.readFile(markdownPath, 'utf8');
USER ```
USER That won't work well for more than one survey, which defeats the whole purpose of this function. I need to be able to pass markdown text in the function call, and I need the `markdown-to-survey.http` updated to read the contents of the file and pass it up to the function call. 
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about improving the markdown parsing function for an Azure Function that converts markdown survey files into structured JSON. We previously discussed creating an `index.js` file in the `MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/` directory that uses the `marked` library to parse markdown.
USER 
USER I updated the parsing function to handle more complex markdown structures, including:
USER - Multiple survey sections
USER - Checkbox-style multiple choice questions
USER - Open text response questions
USER - A more hierarchical JSON output structure
USER 
USER The function now creates a more detailed JSON representation with a `sections` array, and can differentiate between different question types based on markdown formatting. I suggested using shell commands to test the function by installing dependencies and starting the Azure Function locally.

USER Currently, the function is expecting the markdown form to be available in the same directory:
USER ```js
USER         const markdownContent = await fs.readFile(markdownPath, 'utf8');
USER ```
USER That won't work well for more than one survey, which defeats the whole purpose of this function. I need to be able to pass markdown text in the function call, and I need the `markdown-to-survey.http` updated to read the contents of the file and pass it up to the function call.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes accomplish:
ASSISTANT 1. `parseMarkdownToForm()` now accepts markdown text directly instead of a file path
ASSISTANT 2. The function handler checks for markdown content in the request body
ASSISTANT 3. The HTTP test file now reads the markdown file contents and sends it in the request
ASSISTANT 4. Added error handling for missing markdown content
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Shell commands to test:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cd MarkdownToSurvey

ASSISTANT Ok

USER Ok, I have the function running locally, and I have added some logging to the `index.js` to help me parse the uploaded document, but I am getting this: 
USER ```json
USER '[{"type":"paragraph","raw":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","text":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","text":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}"}]}]'
USER ```
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.

ASSISTANT This looks like the HTTP test file is not properly reading the file contents. The `{{$fileContent markdownFile}}` is being passed as a literal string instead of being replaced with the actual file contents.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's modify the `markdown-to-survey.http` file to ensure it's reading the file correctly:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/test/markdown-to-survey.http
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT ### Read Markdown File
ASSISTANT @markdown = {{$fileContent markdownFile}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ### Send Markdown to Function
ASSISTANT POST {{rootUrl}}/api/MarkdownToSurvey HTTP/1.1
ASSISTANT Content-Type: application/json
ASSISTANT x-functions-key: {{$dotenv _master}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "markdown": "{{markdown}}"
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT ### Read Markdown File
ASSISTANT @markdown = {{$fileContent UserSurvey.md}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ### Send Markdown to Function
ASSISTANT POST {{rootUrl}}/api/MarkdownToSurvey HTTP/1.1
ASSISTANT Content-Type: application/json
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "markdown": "{{markdown}}"
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes:
ASSISTANT 1. Explicitly use the filename `UserSurvey.md`
ASSISTANT 2. Removed the `x-functions-key` header for local testing
ASSISTANT 3. Removed the `{{$dotenv _master}}` placeholder
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, let's modify the `index.js` to add more detailed logging:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT console.dir(JSON.stringify(tokens));
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT console.log('Raw Markdown Content:', markdownContent);
ASSISTANT console.log('Parsed Tokens:', JSON.stringify(tokens, null, 2));
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should help diagnose the issue with file content parsing. The key things to check:
ASSISTANT 1. Is the markdown file being read correctly?
ASSISTANT 2. Are the tokens being parsed as expected?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Shell commands to test:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cd MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT npm install
ASSISTANT func start
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to make any further modifications?

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about improving the markdown parsing function for an Azure Function that converts markdown survey files into structured JSON. We were working on modifying the `index.js` and `markdown-to-survey.http` files to allow passing markdown text directly to the function instead of relying on a file path.
USER 
USER The key changes we made include:
USER - Updating the `parseMarkdownToForm()` function to accept markdown content as a parameter
USER - Modifying the Azure Function handler to read markdown from the request body
USER - Updating the HTTP test file to read markdown from a local file and send it in the request
USER - Adding error handling for cases where no markdown content is provided
USER 
USER The changes allow more flexibility in how markdown surveys can be processed, enabling the function to work with markdown text passed directly during the function call.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER Ok, I have the function running locally, and I have added some logging to the `index.js` to help me parse the uploaded document, but I am getting this: 
USER ```json
USER '[{"type":"paragraph","raw":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","text":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","text":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}"}]}]'

USER I think your `markdown-to-survey.http` is just passing the path to the markdown file, whereas it needs to pass the contents. I think the file content might have to be converted to base64, but I think the Rest Client has a way of doing that.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-17T11:44:59
ASSISTANT You're right. The Rest Client extension in VS Code has a built-in way to read file contents. Let's modify the `markdown-to-survey.http` file to correctly read and pass the file contents:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/test/markdown-to-survey.http
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT ### Read Markdown File
ASSISTANT @markdown = {{$fileContent UserSurvey.md}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ### Send Markdown to Function
ASSISTANT POST {{rootUrl}}/api/MarkdownToSurvey HTTP/1.1
ASSISTANT Content-Type: application/json
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "markdown": "{{markdown}}"
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT ### Send Markdown to Function
ASSISTANT POST {{rootUrl}}/api/MarkdownToSurvey HTTP/1.1
ASSISTANT Content-Type: application/json
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "markdown": {{$readFile UserSurvey.md}}
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The key change is using `{{$readFile UserSurvey.md}}` instead of `{{$fileContent UserSurvey.md}}`. The `$readFile` helper in the Rest Client extension reads the entire file contents directly, which should resolve the issue of passing the literal file path string.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This modification should ensure that the actual contents of the `UserSurvey.md` file are sent in the request body, rather than the file path placeholder.
TO LLM 2024-11-17T11:46:39

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about improving the markdown parsing function for an Azure Function that converts markdown survey files into structured JSON. We were working on modifying the `index.js` and `markdown-to-survey.http` files to allow passing markdown text directly to the function instead of relying on a file path.
USER 
USER The key changes we made include:
USER - Updating the `parseMarkdownToForm()` function to accept markdown content as a parameter
USER - Modifying the Azure Function handler to read markdown from the request body
USER - Updating the HTTP test file to read markdown from a local file and send it in the request
USER - Adding error handling for cases where no markdown content is provided
USER 
USER The changes allow more flexibility in how markdown surveys can be processed, enabling the function to work with markdown text passed directly during the function call.

ASSISTANT Ok

USER Ok, I have the function running locally, and I have added some logging to the `index.js` to help me parse the uploaded document, but I am getting this: 
USER ```json
USER '[{"type":"paragraph","raw":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","text":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}","text":"{{$fileContent markdownFile}}"}]}]'
USER ```

ASSISTANT This looks like the HTTP test file is not properly reading the file contents. The `{{$fileContent markdownFile}}` is being passed as a literal string instead of being replaced with the actual file contents.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's modify the `markdown-to-survey.http` file to ensure it's reading the file correctly:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/test/markdown-to-survey.http
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT ### Read Markdown File
ASSISTANT @markdown = {{$fileContent markdownFile}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ### Send Markdown to Function
ASSISTANT POST {{rootUrl}}/api/MarkdownToSurvey HTTP/1.1
ASSISTANT Content-Type: application/json
ASSISTANT x-functions-key: {{$dotenv _master}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "markdown": "{{markdown}}"
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT ### Read Markdown File
ASSISTANT @markdown = {{$fileContent UserSurvey.md}}
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ### Send Markdown to Function
ASSISTANT POST {{rootUrl}}/api/MarkdownToSurvey HTTP/1.1
ASSISTANT Content-Type: application/json
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT {
ASSISTANT   "markdown": "{{markdown}}"
ASSISTANT }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes:
ASSISTANT 1. Explicitly use the filename `UserSurvey.md`
ASSISTANT 2. Removed the `x-functions-key` header for local testing
ASSISTANT 3. Removed the `{{$dotenv _master}}` placeholder
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, let's modify the `index.js` to add more detailed logging:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT MarkdownToSurvey/src/functions/MarkdownToSurvey/index.js
ASSISTANT ```javascript
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT console.dir(JSON.stringify(tokens));
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT console.log('Raw Markdown Content:', markdownContent);
ASSISTANT console.log('Parsed Tokens:', JSON.stringify(tokens, null, 2));
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should help diagnose the issue with file content parsing. The key things to check:
ASSISTANT 1. Is the markdown file being read correctly?
ASSISTANT 2. Are the tokens being parsed as expected?
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Shell commands to test:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT cd MarkdownToSurvey
ASSISTANT npm install
ASSISTANT func start
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to make any further modifications?

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER The function is already running locally, so you don't need to keep restarting it, but if you did you'd have to use `npm start` if you want to start it from the `package.json` dir. Now, I'm getting this:

USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes:
ASSISTANT 1. Use `request.text()` to get the raw body
ASSISTANT 2. Log the raw request body
ASSISTANT 3. Manually parse the JSON with explicit error handling
ASSISTANT 4. Add more detailed error logging
ASSISTANT 5. Include error stack trace in the response for debugging
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should help diagnose any JSON parsing issues and provide more informative error messages.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.

# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.

ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about improving the markdown parsing function for an Azure Function that converts markdown survey files into structured JSON. We were previously working on modifying the `index.js` and `markdown-to-survey.http` files to allow passing markdown text directly to the function.
USER 
USER In our most recent conversation, we discovered that the HTTP test file was not correctly reading the markdown file contents. I suggested using the `{{$readFile UserSurvey.md}}` helper in the Rest Client extension to properly read and pass the file contents in the request body, replacing the previous method that was passing a literal file path string.
USER 
USER The key changes involve updating the `markdown-to-survey.http` file to use the correct file reading method, which should resolve the issue of sending the markdown content to the Azure Function.

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER That gives me this:
USER ```
USER HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
USER Connection: close
USER Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
USER Date: Sun, 17 Nov 2024 19:45:20 GMT
USER Server: Kestrel
USER Transfer-Encoding: chunked
USER 
USER {
USER   "error": "Failed to generate form",
USER   "message": "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 17"
USER }
USER ```

ASSISTANT The error suggests there might be an issue with JSON parsing. Let's modify the `index.js` to add more robust error handling and logging:

ASSISTANT             })
ASSISTANT         };
ASSISTANT     }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes:
ASSISTANT 1. Use `request.text()` to get the raw body
ASSISTANT 2. Log the raw request body
ASSISTANT 3. Manually parse the JSON with explicit error handling
ASSISTANT 4. Add more detailed error logging
ASSISTANT 5. Include error stack trace in the response for debugging
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should help diagnose any JSON parsing issues and provide more informative error messages.

USER I updated the files.

USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH

USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.

SYSTEM type: text
SYSTEM text: Act as an expert software developer.
Always use best practices when coding.
Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

Always reply to the user in in the same language they are using.

Once you understand the request you MUST:

1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
End your reply and wait for their approval.
You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.

2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
- Platform: Linux-5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
- Shell: SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
- Language: C
- Current date: 2024-11-17
- The user is operating inside a git repository

Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.


# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

ASSISTANT text: Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
ASSISTANT cache_control: {'type': 'ephemeral'}

USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER I asked you about improving the markdown parsing function for an Azure Function that converts markdown survey files into structured JSON. We were previously working on modifying the `index.js` and `markdown-to-survey.http` files to allow passing markdown text directly to the function.
USER 
USER In our most recent conversation, we discovered that the HTTP test file was not correctly reading the markdown file contents. I suggested using the `{{$readFile UserSurvey.md}}` helper in the Rest Client extension to properly read and pass the file contents in the request body, replacing the previous method that was passing a literal file path string.
USER 
USER The key changes involve updating the `markdown-to-survey.http` file to use the correct file reading method, which should resolve the issue of sending the markdown content to the Azure Function.

USER I updated the files.

ASSISTANT Ok.

USER That gives me this:
USER ```
USER HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
USER Connection: close
USER Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

USER 
USER {
USER   "error": "Failed to generate form",
USER   "message": "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 17"

ASSISTANT The error suggests there might be an issue with JSON parsing. Let's modify the `index.js` to add more robust error handling and logging:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes:
ASSISTANT 1. Use `request.text()` to get the raw body
ASSISTANT 2. Log the raw request body
ASSISTANT 3. Manually parse the JSON with explicit error handling
ASSISTANT 4. Add more detailed error logging
ASSISTANT 5. Include error stack trace in the response for debugging
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should help diagnose any JSON parsing issues and provide more informative error messages.

USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

LLM RESPONSE 2024-11-17T11:55:56
ASSISTANT The error suggests that the function is expecting a JSON object with a `markdown` property, but the REST Client is sending the raw file contents directly. We'll modify the `index.js` to handle raw markdown content:

ASSISTANT                 })
ASSISTANT             };
ASSISTANT         }
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes:
ASSISTANT 1. First try to parse the body as JSON
ASSISTANT 2. If JSON parsing fails, treat the entire body as raw markdown
ASSISTANT 3. Maintain the existing error handling for missing markdown content
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This modification allows the function to accept both JSON with a `markdown` property and raw markdown text directly.
